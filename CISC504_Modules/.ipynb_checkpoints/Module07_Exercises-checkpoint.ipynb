What its going to do is infintely iterator over number until it is told to stop and check if the number is prime, first by checking if the number is greater than 3 (by checking the square root) and then by checking each number between 2 and the square root to see if it has any divisors. If it does then the loop breaks and the current number is increased by one, and the operation contines again.

    "<h3>Generators</h3>\n",
    "Next up we are going to discsuse generator functions. Generator functions are special functions that use the <b>yield</b> keyword in place of a <b>return</b>. The normal execution cylce for a function is:<br/>\n",
    "1. Get called. <br/>\n",
    "2. Do a calculation. <br/>\n",
    "3. Return the result. <br/> \n",
    "Not all functions need to operate this way though. A generator function can get called, <b>yield</b> a result which is give back to the primary operator, but still keep running and later yield more results. These yielded results get collected into a data structure and can continually be added to until the generator has fully returned its payload. The advantage to a generator is that the program can contiue to operate with the dataset that is being built while the program is also still building it. Its essentially mutlithreading itself, or acting in parallel. Generators adhere to the Iterator contract by default so they can be used in comprehensions without any further work. In the below example, we take the calculation that was done by the second prime number calculator but we yield the results instead of have them calculated in the <code>__next__()</code> method. This allows the code to keep running while the generator builds the data out. "

    "<h3>Regular Expressions (REGEX)</h3>\n",
    "Finally we arrive at regular expressions. A regular express, or regex, is a way to process text by defining patterns and symbol structures to capture strings. This can be useful for trying to find URL links in tabs by searching for the pattern, HTTPS:// but what if the url isn't HTTPS? Maybe its just HTTP? Then we need to account for that as well. You could do this by checking characters and making patters but it would be a lot easier to use a regular express. In Python it would look something like this: <b>https?://\\S+</b>. Which says find <b>http</b> and an optional <b>s</b> then a literal <b>//</b> and finally <b>\\S+</b> is one or more non whitespace characters. Python regular expression syntax is immense and we aren't going to cover all the grammar here.

    "In the below code, we have a simple string and a pattern to look for. We can search for it using the <code>search()</code> method from the <code>re</code> module. This pattern equates to a character that is repeated next to itself, such as <b>aa</b> or <b>bb</b>. You can see we found a match at index 35 and 36 with <b>ff</b> in <i>different</i>. "
