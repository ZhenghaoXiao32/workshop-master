    "You are going to create a Monte Carlo style experiment to estimate the value of mathematical pi. A Monte Carlo style experiment is a technique that is used for approximating a numerical solution using random numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, you are going to generate a random point on the X,Y axis where both X and Y are between 0 and 1. Using those points you can plug them into the equations, sqrt(x**2 + y**2). If the result of that equation is less than 1, then the point is inside a cirlce that exists as the point 0,0 as its center with a radius of 1. You can then multiply the number of points within the circle by four and divided that by the total points to get an estimate for pi. \n",
